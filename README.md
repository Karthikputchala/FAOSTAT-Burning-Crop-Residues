# FAOSTAT-Burning-Crop-Residues

Project based on  Data Analysis &amp; Visualization.
## Introduction 
Methane (CH4), Nitrous oxide (N2O), and Biomass are the main green house gas emissions (GHG) that are emitted from burning crop wastes. The FAOSTAT (Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations) has collected this data from every country through the activity of residue dissemination by burning the selected crops â€“ maize, sugarcane, wheat, and rice. It also includes the emission data reported by countries to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).

## Acknowledgements
Data Used:

- I had collected the data from the FAOSTAT website regarding the topic "Burning Crop residues". This data consists of the amount of emissions released by all the countries from burning the crop wastes of Maize (corn), Rice, Wheat, Sugarcane. It also had the data with the future emission estimate upto the year 2050.
